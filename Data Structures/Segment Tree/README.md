### Problem Statement
Segment tree...

### Complexity
- **Time**: $O(\log n)$
- **Memory**: $O(n)$

### Core Ideas
Just a segment tree. It does, however, use the iterative version on non-lazy segtrees *without* assuming commutativity.
Also has memory and time optimizations in the 2D versions.

### Tests and Benchmarks
All over the place, it's all good.
