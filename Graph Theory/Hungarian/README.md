### Problem Statement
Minimum cost matching on bipartite graph, with $n$ vertices on left side and $m$ on right.
Assumes the graph is complete, which can basically always be assumed since non-existent edges can be given infinite cost.

### Complexity
- **Time**: $O(n^2m)$
- **Memory**: $O(nm)$

### Core Ideas
TODO
