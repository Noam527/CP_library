### Problem Statement
Implements a number modulo a prime, with basic operations.

### Complexity
- **Time**: Operations `+-*` are $O(1)$, while `^/` and inverse are logarithmic. Factorials are prepared in linear time and can compute binomials in $O(1)$.

### Core Ideas
Nothing much. Relatively minimizes modulo operations to save time.
